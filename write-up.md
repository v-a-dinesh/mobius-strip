# Mobius Strip Implementation: Technical Write-up

## How I Structured the Code

I implemented the Mobius strip using an object-oriented approach centered around a `MobiusStrip` class. This structure provides several advantages:

1. **Encapsulation**: All data and operations related to the Mobius strip are contained within a single class, making the code modular and self-contained.
2. **Clear Interface**: The class exposes well-defined methods for mesh generation, geometric calculations, and visualization, with a clean separation of concerns.
3. **Extensibility**: This structure makes it easy to add additional geometric properties or visualization options in the future.

The code follows this overall organization:

- **Constructor** (`__init__`): Initializes parameters and generates the mesh
- **Private method** (`_generate_mesh`): Creates the 3D mesh using parametric equations
- **Calculation methods**: Separate methods for surface area and edge length
- **Visualization method**: Handles the 3D rendering of the strip
- **Main execution block**: Demonstrates usage and displays results

This approach follows good software engineering practices by separating implementation details from the public interface and organizing related functionality together.

## How I Approximated Surface Area

Computing the surface area of a parametric surface requires integrating the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives over the parameter domain. I implemented this using numerical integration:

1. **Partial Derivatives**: For each point (u,v) in the parameter space, I calculated:
   - ∂r/∂u: The partial derivative with respect to u
   - ∂r/∂v: The partial derivative with respect to v

2. **Cross Product**: I computed the cross product of these derivatives, which gives a vector perpendicular to the surface with magnitude proportional to the area element.

3. **Numerical Integration**: I divided the parameter space into a grid and summed the contributions from each grid cell:

   ```
   surface_area ≈ ∑∑ ||∂r/∂u × ∂r/∂v|| · du · dv
   ```

4. **Boundary Handling**: I excluded the boundary points from the integration to avoid potential issues with discontinuities.

This approach essentially approximates the surface integral as a Riemann sum over the parameter domain, with the accuracy improving as the resolution (n) increases.

## Challenges Faced

Several challenges arose during implementation:

1. **Numerical Stability in Surface Area Calculation**: The derivatives in the surface area calculation can become quite complex, and ensuring numerical stability across the entire parameter space required careful implementation.

2. **Visualization Edge Cases**: Finding the exact indices for the center line and edge of the strip proved challenging. The initial approach using `np.isclose()` failed when the discretization didn't include points sufficiently close to 0 or w/2. I resolved this by finding the closest points instead.

3. **Resolution Trade-offs**: Balancing computational efficiency with accuracy required careful selection of the resolution parameter. Too low resolution yields inaccurate geometric properties, while too high resolution slows down the computation significantly.

4. **3D Visualization Setup**: Setting appropriate camera angles, aspect ratios, and color schemes to clearly show the Mobius strip's topology was challenging. I had to carefully configure the matplotlib 3D axes to provide a clear view of the surface.

5. **Parametrization Understanding**: Working with the parametric equations required a solid understanding of how the parameters (u,v) map to the 3D surface, especially for calculating geometric properties correctly.

The most significant challenge was implementing the surface area calculation, as it required carefully deriving and implementing the partial derivatives of the parametric equations, which involve complex trigonometric expressions. I addressed this by breaking down the calculation into manageable components and validating intermediary results.
